"""
Checks messages such that they are not duplicates of messages sent previously in the discord channel(s).
This is designed to increase the effort required by users. For example, the string 'lol' can only be used
once, and subsequent uses must get more creative (e.g. 'l0l', 'lolz', and so on).
Eventually, some time in the future, all possible strings will have been said, and the database will need to be reset.
